Navigator
=========

The navigator will take xml files, placing the data into json, and create spring embedded directory systems using arbor.js.

##Goal
Navigator will be created in HTML5 and will start with created a spring embedded system from [SOCR](http://socr.ucla.edu), Statistics Online Computational Resource .
The previous directory system is written in 'java' and is outdated. After updating the [SOCR](http://socr.ucla.edu), 
we will expand the script to take in any xml directory and convert it to a newer spring embedded directory.
